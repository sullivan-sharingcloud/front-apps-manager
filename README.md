# Front apps manager

This tool serves an API that you'll be able to use to determine what version of front-end `Application` you want to serve to a given `CloudMember`.
This system will resolve dependencies for you and will listen for all application deployments to handle automatic release of `ApplicationVersions`.

All Business rules are written here.
